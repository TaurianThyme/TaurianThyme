- 👋 Hi, I’m @TaurianThyme
- 👀 I’m interested in drawing, music (k-pop, specifically BTS, Stray Kids, BlackPink and TXT), playing guitar, reading and making Lego.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning guitar, tennis, coding (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), and trying to improve my drawing skills!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on multiple projects - I'm still learning!
- 📫 How to reach me: taurian.thyme@gmail.com
